# This script reads a testNG results XML file with a root element like:
# <testng-results skipped="96" failed="17" total="2228" passed="2115">
# It extracts the number of passed, failed, and skipped tests, and prints
# the results with ANSI colors: green for passed, red for failed, and no color for skipped.
# If there are any failed tests (failed > 0), the script exits with a status code of 1.
#
# This script is used in the Makefile to fail the test run if there are failures, since
# when using the teamengine REST API to produce the xml report, it will always return a 200 HTTP status code.
#
# Contrary to testng-results-report.sh, this script does not require xmlstarlet to be installed,
# and can be used to fail the build if there are test failures regardless of whether a detailed
# report can be printed out.
