# Default REST security configuration.
# 
# By default this configuration locks down every rest call. The following is an example of a more
# lax configuration in which read only (GET) access is allowed anonymously:
# 
#/**;GET=IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY
#/**;POST,DELETE,PUT=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
#
# The following is an example of a configuration that could be used with the restconfig plugin in 
# which only configuration in a specific workspace is restricted:
#
#/rest/workspaces/topp*;GET=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
#/rest/workspaces/topp/**;GET=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
#/**;POST,DELETE,PUT=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
#
# Next line enables access to user self-admin operations (such as changing own password):
# 
#/rest/security/self/**;PUT=ROLE_AUTHENTICATED
#
#
/**;GET=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
/**;POST,DELETE,PUT=ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR
