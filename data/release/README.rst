To quote from the http://grass.osgeo.org/uploads/grass/sampledata/spearDB.pdf ::

    A majority of this spearfish database was initially provided to USACERL by the EROS Data Center
    (EDC) in Sioux Falls, SD. The GRASS Development staff expresses acknowledgement and thanks to: the
    U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and EROS Data Center for allowing us to distribute this data with our
    release of GRASS software; and to the U.S. Census Bureau for their samples of TIGER/Line data and the
    STF1 data which were used in the development of the TIGER programs and tutorials. Thanks also to
    SPOT Image Corporation for providing multispectral and panchromatic satellite imagery for a portion of
    the spearfish data set and for allowing us to distribute this imagery with GRASS software. In addition to
    the data provided by the EDC and SPOT, researchers at USACERL have developed several new layers, thus
    enhancing the spearfish data set.
