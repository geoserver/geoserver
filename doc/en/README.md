# Documentation Instructions

For writing guide please generate and review [docguide](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/docguide/). Documentation is written in a combination of:

* [sphinx-doc.org](http://www.sphinx-doc.org): user manual, developers guide and documentation guide
* [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) - REST API reference documentation

GeoServer documentation is released using [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](LICENSE.md).

## Python and Sphinx Setup

The documentation is written with [sphinx-build](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), which is a Python documentation generator.

To install ``sphinx-build`` and ``sphinx-autobuild`` using ``requirements.txt``:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To confirm installation:
```
sphinx-build --version
sphinx-autobuild --version
```

### Python Virtual Environment Setup (Optional)

To establish a virtual environment just for this project (macOS example):

```
brew install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```

To activate python:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

To install requirements into virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To confirm installation:
```
sphinx-build --version
sphinx-autobuild --version
```

## Building with Maven

To build:

    mvn clean install

### index.html

The file `index.html` is the landing page for the [online documentation](https://docs.geoserver.org/index.html). It exists outside of the version hierarchy of the rest of the documentation.

### REST API

To generate the REST API documentation:

    mvn process-resources
    
To generate a specific REST API endpoint:

    mvn process-resources:system-status

### Manuals

To build all restructured text documentation:

    mvn compile

And to package into zips:

    mvn package

Profiles are defined to build individual manuals:

    mvn compile -Puser
    mvn compile -Pdeveloper
    mvn compile -Pdocguide

And can be packaged individually:
    
    mvn package:single@user
    mvn package:single@developer
    mvn package:single@docguide

To generate user pdf:

    mvn compile -Puser-pdf
    
#### Writing

The ant ``build.xml`` can also be called directly:

    ant user

This uses ``sphinx-build`` to generate documentation into ``target/user/html/index.html``.

To view content while editing:

    ant user-site

This uses ``sphinx-autobuild`` to serve docs on next available port, opening a browser to review generated pages. The browser will refresh as pages are edited and saved.


Additional targets are available:

    ant developer
    ant developer-site
    ant docguide
    ant docguide-site

Customize output with current ``project.version`` name:

    ant user -Dproject.version=2.23.1
