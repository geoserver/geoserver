Manual Release (Deprecated)
===========================

.. warning::

   This release guide is deprecated and only kept currently for reference resources. See the :ref:`official release guide <release_guide>` for current practices.

Before you start
----------------

GeoTools release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For any non-beta release (including release candidates) a GeoServer release requires a corresponding GeoTools release. Therefore before you start you should coordinate a GeoTools release. Either performing the release yourself or asking on the GeoTools devel list for a volunteer to perform the release.

TODO: point to geotools release docs

Notify developer list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is good practice to notify the `GeoServer developer list <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geoserver-devel>`_ of the intention to make the release a few days in advance, even though the release date has been agreed upon before hand.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following are necessary to perform a GeoServer release:

#. Commit access to the GeoServer `Git repository <https://Github.com/geoserver/geoserver>`_
#. Build access to `Hudson <http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson>`_
#. Edit access to the GeoServer `Blog <http://blog.geoserver.org>`_
#. Administration rights to `GeoServer JIRA <https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS>`_
#. Release/file management privileges in `SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/>`_

Versions and revisions
----------------------

When performing a release we don't require a "code freeze" in which no developers can commit to the repository. Instead we release from a revision that is known to pass all tests, including unit/integration tests as well as CITE tests.

To obtain the GeoServer and Geotools revisions that have passed the `CITE test <http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/view/cite/>`_, navigate to the latest Hudson run of the CITE test  and view it's console output and select to view its full log. For example::

	 http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/view/cite/job/cite-wfs-1.1-master/526/consoleFull

Perform a search on the log for 'Git revision' and you should obtain the following.::

	version = 2.4-SNAPSHOT
	Git revision = 68cbe445ca378e0dd04405870ef95c852189c1b0
	Git branch = 68cbe445ca378e0dd04405870ef95c852189c1b0
	build date = 08-Jul-2012 03:36
	geotools version = 9-SNAPSHOT
	geotools revision = 9517eebf412ce5cda354e7945672293c37cddcc4

Since most GeoServer releases require an official GeoTools release the GEoTools revision is usually not needed. But if performing a beta release it is
allowed to release directly from a specific GeoTools revision.

Build the Release
-----------------

Run the `geoserver-release <http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/job/geoserver-release/>`_ job in Hudson. The job takes the following parameters:

**BRANCH**

  The branch to release from, "2.2.x", "2.1.x", etc... This must be a stable branch. Releases are not performed from the main development branch.

**REV**

  The Git revision number to release from. eg, "24ae10fe662c....". If left blank the latest revision (ie HEAD) on the ``BRANCH`` being released is used.

**VERSION**

  The version/name of the release to build, "2.1.4", "2.2", etc...

**GT_VERSION**

  The GeoTools version to include in the release. This may be specified as a version number such as "8.0" or "2.7.5". Alternatively the version may be specified as a Git branch/revision pair in the form ``<branch>@<revision>``. For example "main@36ba65jg53.....". Finally this value may be left blank in which the version currently declared in the geoserver pom will be used (usually a SNAPSHOT). Again if performing a non-beta release this version must be a version number corresponding to an official GeoTools release.

**GWC_VERSION**

  The GeoWebCache version to include in the release. This may be specified as a version number such as "1.3-RC3". Alternatively the version may be specified as a Git revision of the form ``<branch>@<revision>`` such as "master@1b3243jb...". Finally this value may be left blank in which the version currently declared in the geoserver pom will be used (usually a SNAPSHOT).Git Again if performing a non-beta release this version must be a version number corresponding to an official GeoTools release.

**GIT_USER**

  The Git username to use for the release.

**GIT_EMAIL**

  The Git email to use for the release.

This job will checkout the specified branch/revision and build the GeoServer
release artifacts against the GeoTools/GeoWebCache versions specified. When
successfully complete all release artifacts will be uploaded to the following
location::

   http://gridlock.opengeo.org/geoserver/release/<RELEASE>

Additionally when the job completes it fires off two jobs for building the
Windows and OSX installers. These jobs run on different hudson instances.
When those jobs complete the ``.exe`` and ``.dmg`` artifacts will be uploaded
to the location referenced above.

Test the Artifacts
------------------

Download and try out some of the artifacts from the above location and do a
quick smoke test that there are no issues. Engage other developers to help
test on the developer list.

Release in JIRA
---------------

Run the `geoserver-release-jira <http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/job/geoserver-release-jira/>`_ job in Hudson. The job takes the following parameters:

**VERSION**

  The version to release, same as in the previous section. This version must match a version in JIRA.

**NEXT_VERSION**

  The next version in the series. All unresolved issues currently fils against ``VERSION`` will be transitioned to this version.

**JIRA_USER**

  A JIRA user name that has release privileges. This user  will be used to perform the release in JIRA, via the SOAP api.

**JIRA_PASSWD**

  The password for the ``JIRA_USER``.

This job will perform the tasks in JIRA to release ``VERSION``. Navigate to `JIRA <https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/projects/GEOS>`__ and verify that the version has actually been released.

Publish the Release
-------------------

Run the `geoserver-release-publish <https://build.geoserver.org/view/release/job/geoserver-release-publish/>`__ in Jenkins. The job takes the following parameters:

**VERSION**

  The version being released. The same value s specified for ``VERSION`` when running the ``geoserver-release`` job.

**BRANCH**

  The branch being released from.  The same value specified for ``BRANCH`` when running the ``geoserver-release`` job.

This job will rsync all the artifacts located at::

     http://gridlock.opengeo.org/geoserver/release/<RELEASE>

to the SourceForge FRS server. Navigate to `Sourceforge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/>`__ and verify that the artifacts have been uploaded properly. Set the necessary flags on the ``.exe``, ``.dmg`` and ``.bin`` artifacts so that they show up as the appropriate default for users downloading on the Windows, OSX, and Linux platforms.
