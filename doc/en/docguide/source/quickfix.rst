Quickfix
========

For really quick fixes:

#. Browse the documentation source code directly on the GitHub website:

   *  https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/tree/main/doc/en

#. Navigate to the file you wish to change and click the **edit** icon
   
   .. figure:: github_edit1.png
      
      GitHub Preview of style.rst page

   Note: you must first be signed into GitHub, and GitHub will help you create a fork from which to submit the quick fix, (we recommend that you keep the fork for next time.)

#. Use the editor to modify the file

   .. figure:: github_edit1.png
      
      GitHub Editor for style.rst page

#. Scroll to the bottom of the page, provide a commit comment and submit.

#. GitHub will:
   
   * Create a fork and submit a pull request on your behalf; or
   * Immediately make the change for those with commit access

.. warning:: This technique is great for fixing small typos - but has the danger of introducing formatting mistakes preventing the documentation from being generated.
   
   To make extensive changes see :doc:`workflow`.
