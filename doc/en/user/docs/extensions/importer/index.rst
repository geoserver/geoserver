Importer
========

The Importer extension gives a GeoServer administrator an alternate, more-streamlined method for uploading and configuring new layers.

There are two primary advantages to using the Importer over the standard GeoServer data-loading workflow:

#. **Supports batch operations** (loading and publishing multiple spatial files or database tables in one operation)

#. **Creates unique styles** for each layer, rather than linking to the same (existing) styles.

This section will discuss the Importer extension.
