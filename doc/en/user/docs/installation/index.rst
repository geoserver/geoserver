Installation
============

There are many ways to install GeoServer on your system. This section will discuss the various installation paths available.

.. note:: To run GeoServer as part of an existing servlet container such as Tomcat, please see the :ref:`installation_war` section.

.. warning:: GeoServer requires a Java 11 or Java 17 environment (JRE) to be installed on your system, available from `OpenJDK <http://openjdk.java.net>`__, `Adoptium <https://adoptium.net>`__ for Windows and macOS installers, or provided by your OS distribution.

   This must be done prior to installation.
