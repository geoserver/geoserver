Advanced configuration
======================

GeoServer provides a variety of options to customize your service for different situations.  While none of the configuration options discussed in this section are required for a basic GeoServer installation, they allow you to adapt your GeoServer to your own needs, beyond the options exposed in OGC standard services.
