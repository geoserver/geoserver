Features-Templating Extension
=============================

The Features Templating plug-in works by allowing us to define a What You See Is What You Get template, that will be applied on a stream of features respecting the defined content negotiation rules. Both Simple and Complex features are supported. The following services and operations are supported:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20

   * - **Service**
     - **Operation**
   * - WFS
     - GetFeature
   * - WMS
     - GetFeatureInfo
   * - OGCAPI Features
     - Collection

The following output formats are supported:

* ``GeoJSON``
* ``GML``
* ``JSON-LD`` `JSON-LD <https://json-ld.org>`_ is a Linked Data format, based on JSON format, and revolves around the concept of "context" to provide additional mappings from JSON to an RDF model.
* ``HTML``

The first part of the plug-in documentation will go through the template syntax. The second one will show how to configure the template to apply it to a vector layer. The third part shows the backwards mapping functionality.
