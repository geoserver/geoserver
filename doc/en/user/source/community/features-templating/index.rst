Features-Templating Extension
=============================

This plugin brings the possibility to output features by using a template file as a second level mapping over features, in order to obtain either a JSON-LD or a customized GeoJSON output. 
`JSON-LD <https://json-ld.org>`_ is a Linked Data format, based on JSON format, and revolves around the concept of "context" to provide additional mappings from JSON to an RDF model.

The plugin works for both simple and complex-features.
