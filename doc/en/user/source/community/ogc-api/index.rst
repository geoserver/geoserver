OGC API modules
===============

The `OGC API Standards <https://www.ogc.org/publications/>`__ are defined by the `Open Geospatial Consortium <http://www.opengeospatial.org>`__ as a family of resource-centric REST services, each documented as by an OpenAPI documenting outlining the capabilities and datasets published.

Each standard is defined by a core, which is require to be implemented, and optional extensions, documented as the a set of conformances indicating which features are implemented and available.

Configure:

* :ref:`ogcapi_links`

Extensions:

* :doc:`/services/features/index`

Community modules:

   testbed

.. warning::
   
   The OGC API services are still in heavy development, most of the specs and extensions are still in draft form and their behavior are subject to change in the coming months/years.

.. admonition:: How to help

   The modules are still in their infancy, there is a set of activities that could help their development:

   * Implementation of additional draft API services, such as the `Maps API <https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-API-Maps>`_,
     the `Coverages API <https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc_api_coverages>`_, the `Records API <https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records>`_
     and the `Process API <https://github.com/opengeospatial/wps-rest-binding>`_.
   * Implementation of new draft extensions not yet covered, like the `OGC Features API Transaction extension <https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/tree/master/extensions/transactions>`_.
   * Improvement of the HTML representation of resources, both in terms of looks and functionality 
     (the specification makes no mandate for these pages, so they may be implemented as we see fit).
   * Testing and improvement of the OpenAPI documents generated by each service, with particular focus on automatic generation of clients.
   * General testing, reporting and bug fixing.
   
   Check documentation pages for "implementation status" outlining present state of development.
