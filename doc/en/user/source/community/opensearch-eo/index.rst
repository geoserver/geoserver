.. note:: The OpenSearch for EO and STAC modules are pending modules, meaning you'll find them
    in the releases, but are not yet officially supported. In order for this module to graduate
    to supported extensions, we'll need more installations and some more experience about
    the best catalog storage system (currently PostGIS, but it might move to Elasticsearch).
    Please contact andrea.aime@geosolutionsgroup.com to assist with testing and feedback.
