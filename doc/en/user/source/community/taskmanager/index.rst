Geoserver Task Manager
======================

The GeoServer Task Manager is a tool that allows scheduled tasks and
batches to run inside a GeoServer instance. The initial purpose of the
task manager was to synchronize data and metadata between different
geoserver instances and their data sources, as to automise and assist a
particular workflow within an organisation that includes pre-tested
publications and frequent updates. However, the task manager offers an
extensive and flexible API that makes it possible to write any kind of
extensions and customisations, allowing other purposes as well.
