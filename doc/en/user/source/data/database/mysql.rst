MySQL
=====

.. note:: GeoServer does not come built-in with support for MySQL; it must be installed through an extension. Proceed to :ref:`mysql_install` for installation details.

.. warning:: Currently the MySQL extension is unmaintained and carries unsupported status. While still usable, do not expect the same reliability as with other extensions.

`MySQL <http://www.mysql.com>`_ is an open source relational database with some limited spatial functionality.

.. _mysql_install:

Installing the MySQL extension
------------------------------

#. Visit the :website:`website download <download>` page, locate your release, and download:

   * |release| :download_extension:`mysql`
   * |version| :nightly_extension:`mysql`
   
   .. warning:: Ensure to match plugin (example |release| above) version to the version of the GeoServer instance.

#. Extract the contents of the archive into the :file:`WEB-INF/lib` directory of the GeoServer installation.

Adding a MySQL database
-----------------------

Once the extension is properly installed ``MySQL`` will show up as an option when creating a new data store.
