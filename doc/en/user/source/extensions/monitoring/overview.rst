===================

The following diagram outlines the architecture of the monitor extension:

     *Monitor extension architecture*

As a request is processed the monitor inserts itself at particular points in 
the request life cycle to capture various information about the request. Such 
information includes:

* Timestamp of the origin of the request
* Total time it took for the request to complete
* Origin of the request 
* HTTP information such as the body content type, header information, etc...

And more. See the :ref:`monitor_reference` section for a complete list.

In addition to capturing request data the monitor extension is also capable
of persisting it. Two options are provided out of the box:

* Persisting to a relational database (this used to be a community module) 
* Piping to a log file, see :ref:`monitor_audit` for more details

By default the extension will do neither and simply maintain data for only
the most recent requests. The data is stored in memory meaning that if the
server is restarted or shutdown this information is lost. The 
:ref:`monitor_configuration` section provides a comprehensive guide to 
configuring the monitor extension.  

Stored request information is made available through a simple 
:ref:`query api <monitor_query_api>` that allows clients to access 
request data through a HTTP interface.
