GeoServer Printing Module
=========================

The ``printing`` module for GeoServer allows easy hosting of the Mapfish
printing service within a GeoServer instance.  The Mapfish printing module
provides an HTTP API for printing that is useful within JavaScript mapping
applications.  User interface components for interacting with the print service
are available from the Mapfish and GeoExt projects.
