The most common way to install GeoServer is using the OS-independent binary.  This version is a GeoServer web application (webapp) bundled inside `Jetty <http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/>`_, a lightweight servlet container system.  It has the advantages of working very similarly across all operating systems plus being very simple to set up.

The setup instructions are very similar to that of the Mac OS X :ref:`installation_osx_bin`.  

Java
----

GeoServer requires Java to be installed on your system.  Oracle Java SE 6 or newer is strongly recommended.  (As of GeoServer 2.2.x, Oracle JRE 5 is no longer supported.)  A Java Development Kit (JDK) is not required to run GeoServer.  For more information about Java and GeoServer, please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.
