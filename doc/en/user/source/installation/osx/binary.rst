.. _installation_osx_bin:Mac OS X Binary===============.. note:: This section is for the OS-independent binary.  Please see the section on the :ref:`installation_osx` for the wizard-based installer for OS X.The most common way to install GeoServer is using the OS-independent binary.  This version is a GeoServer web application (webapp) bundled inside `Jetty <http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/>`_, a lightweight servlet container system.  It has the advantages of working very similarly across all operating systems plus being very simple to set up.Installation------------#. Navigate to the `GeoServer Download <http://geoserver.org/download>`_ page and click your preferred GeoServer version--Stable, Maintenance or Development. In "Nightly" builds are provided to help test the latest features of bug fixes.#. On the resulting page, download and save the :guilabel:`Binary (OS independent)` format of your preferred GeoServer version.      .. note:: Download GeoServer wherever you find appropriate.  In this example we download the GeoServer archive to the Desktop.  If GeoServer is in a different location, simply replace ``Desktop`` in the following command to your own folder path.#. After saving the Geoserver archive, move to the location of your download, by first opening a terminal window ( :menuselection:`Applications-->Utitlies-->Terminal`) and then typing the following command:    .. code-block:: bash       cd Desktop/#. Confirm that you are in the right directory by listing its contents.  You should see your specific GeoServer archive (e.g., ``GeoServer-2.0-RC1-bin.zip``) by typing:      .. code-block:: bash       ls -l    #. Unzip ``geoserver-2.0-RC1.zip`` to ``/usr/local/geoserver`` with the following two commands:     .. code-block:: bash       unzip $geoserver-2.0-RC1.zip  .       sudo mv geoserver-2.0-RC1/  geoserver      .. note:: Notice the **.** in the first command.  This means the archive will unzip in the current directory. #. Add an environment variable to save the location of GeoServer by typing the following command:    .. code-block:: bash           echo "export GEOSERVER_HOME=/usr/local/geoserver" >> ~/.profile       . ~/.profile#. Make yourself the owner of the ``geoserver`` folder.  Type the following command in the terminal window, replacing ``USER_NAME`` with your own username :    .. code-block:: bash       sudo chown -R USER_NAME /usr/local/geoserver/#. Start GeoServer by changing into the directory ``geoserver/bin`` and executing the ``startup.sh`` script:    .. code-block:: bash              cd geoserver-1.7.0/bin       sh startup.sh#. Visit ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver`` in a web browser.
