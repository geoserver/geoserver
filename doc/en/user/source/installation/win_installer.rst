.. _installation_windows_installer:Windows installer=================The Windows installer provides an easy way to set up GeoServer on your system, as it requires no configuration files to be edited or command line settings.#. Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. GeoServer requires a **Java 8** environment. The Oracle JRE is preferred, but OpenJDK has been known to work adequately. You can `download JRE 8 from Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>`_.   .. note:: Java 9 is not currently supported.   .. note:: For more information about Java and GeoServer, please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.#. Navigate to the `GeoServer Download page <http://geoserver.org/download>`_.#. Select the version of GeoServer that you wish to download. If you're not sure, select `Stable <http://geoserver.org/release/stable>`_.#. Click the link for the Windows installer.   .. figure:: images/win_download.png      Downloading the Windows installer#. After downloading, double-click the file to launch.#. At the Welcome screen, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_welcome.png      Welcome screen#. Read the :ref:`license` and click :guilabel:`I Agree`.   .. figure:: images/win_license.png      GeoServer license#. Select the directory of the installation, then click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_installdir.png      GeoServer install directory#. Select the Start Menu directory name and location, then click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_startmenu.png      Start menu location#. Enter the path to a **valid Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**. GeoServer requires a valid JRE in order to run, so this step is required. The installer will inspect your system and attempt to automatically populate this box with a JRE if it is found, but otherwise you will have to enter this path manually. When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.      .. note:: A typical path on Windows would be :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre8`.   .. note:: Don't include the :file:`\\bin` in the JRE path. So if :file:`java.exe` is located at :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre8\\bin\\java.exe`, set the path to be :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre8`.   .. note:: For more information about Java and GeoServer, please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.      .. figure:: images/win_jre.png      Selecting a valid JRE#. Enter the path to your GeoServer data directory or select the default. If this is your first time using GeoServer, select the :guilabel:`Default data directory`. When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_datadir.png      Setting a GeoServer data directory#. Enter the username and password for administration of GeoServer. GeoServer's :ref:`web_admin` requires authentication for management, and what is entered here will become those administrator credentials.  The defaults are :guilabel:`admin / geoserver`.  It is recommended to change these from the defaults. When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_creds.png      Setting the username and password for GeoServer administration#. Enter the port that GeoServer will respond on. This affects the location of the GeoServer :ref:`web_admin`, as well as the endpoints of the GeoServer services such as :ref:`wms` and :ref:`wfs`.  The default port is :guilabel:`8080`, though any valid and unused port will work. When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_port.png      Setting the GeoServer port#. Select whether GeoServer should be run manually or installed as a service. When run manually, GeoServer is run like a standard application under the current user. When installed as a service, GeoServer is integrated into Windows Services, and thus is easier to administer. If running on a server, or to manage GeoServer as a service, select :guilabel:`Install as a service`. Otherwise, select :guilabel:`Run manually`.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_service.png      Installing GeoServer as a service#. Review your selections and click the :guilabel:`Back` button if any changes need to be made.  Otherwise, click :guilabel:`Install`.   .. figure:: images/win_review.png      Verifying settings#. GeoServer will install on your system.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Finish` to close the installer.#. If you installed GeoServer as a service, it is already running.  Otherwise, you can start GeoServer by going to the Start Menu, and clicking :guilabel:`Start GeoServer` in the GeoServer folder.#. Navigate to ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver`` (or wherever you installed GeoServer) to access the GeoServer :ref:`web_admin`.If you see the GeoServer logo, then GeoServer is successfully installed.   .. figure:: images/success.png      GeoServer installed and running successfullyUninstallation--------------GeoServer can be uninstalled in two ways: by running the :file:`uninstall.exe` file in the directory where GeoServer was installed, or by standard Windows program removal.
