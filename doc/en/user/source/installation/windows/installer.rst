With no configuration files to edit or command line setting, everything can be done through the Windows GUI.#. Navigate to the GeoServer Download page at `<http://geoserver.org/download>`_.#. Select the version of GeoServer that you wish to download.  If you're not sure, select the Stable version at `<http://geoserver.org/release/stable>`_.  #.

Enter the path to a **valid Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**.  GeoServer requires a valid JRE in order to run, so this step is required.  The installer will inspect your system and attempt to automatically populate this box with the path contained in your ``%JAVA_HOME%`` variable.  If this variable is undefined, you may not have a JRE on your system.  In this case, you can download a JRE at `<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_.  Once the JRE is downloaded and installed, restart the GeoServer installer.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.      ================= ===============================================   Platform          Example Location    ================= ===============================================   Windows           :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7`   WindowsXP         :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre7`   ================= ===============================================      .. warning:: Don't include the :file:`\\bin` in the JRE path.  So if :file:`javaw.exe` is located at :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7\\bin\\javaw.exe`, set the path to be :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7`.   .. info:: Java 7 is required. For more information about Java and GeoServer, please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.      .. figure:: images/win_jre.png      :align: center      *Selecting a valid JRE*#. Enter the path to your GeoServer data directory or select the default.  Previous GeoServer users may already have a data directory that they wish to use.  If this is your first time using GeoServer, you should select the :guilabel:`Default data directory`.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_datadir.png      :align: center      *Setting a GeoServer data directory*#. Enter the username and password for administration of GeoServer.  GeoServer's :ref:`web_admin` requires authentication for management, and what is entered here will become those administrator credentials.  The defaults are :guilabel:`admin / geoserver`.  It is recommended to change these from the defaults, but this is not required.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_creds.png      :align: center      *Setting the username and password for GeoServer administration*#. Enter the port that GeoServer will respond on.  This affects the location of the GeoServer :ref:`web_admin`, as well as the endpoints of the GeoServer :ref:`wms` and :ref:`wfs`.  The default port is :guilabel:`8080`, although any valid unused port will work.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_port.png      :align: center      *Setting the GeoServer port*#. Select whether GeoServer should be run manually or installed as a service.  When run manually, GeoServer is run like a standard application under the current user.  When installed as a service, GeoServer in integrated into Windows Services, and thus is easier to administer.  If running on a server, or to manage GeoServer as a service, select :guilabel:`Install as a service`.  Otherwise, select :guilabel:`Run manually`.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Next`.   .. figure:: images/win_service.png      :align: center      *Installing GeoServer as a service*#. Review your selections and click the :guilabel:`Back` button if any changes need to be made.  Otherwise, click :guilabel:`Install`.   .. figure:: images/win_review.png      :align: center      *Verifying settings*#. GeoServer will install on your system.  When finished, click :guilabel:`Finish` to close the installer.#. If you installed GeoServer as a service, it is already running.  Otherwise, you can start GeoServer by going to the Start Menu, and clicking :guilabel:`Start GeoServer` in the GeoServer folder.#.
