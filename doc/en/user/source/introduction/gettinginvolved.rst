Getting involved
================

GeoServer exists because of the efforts of people like you.

There are many ways that you can help out with the GeoServer project. GeoServer fully embraces an open source development model that does not see a split between user and developer, producer and consumer, but instead sees everyone as a valuable contributor.

GeoServer opperates with full transparency with public `policies and procedures <https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/developer/policies/index.html>`__. We look forward to working with you.

Development
-----------

Helping to develop GeoServer is the obvious way to help out. Developers usually start with bug fixes and other small patches, and then move into larger contributions as they learn the system. Our developers are more than happy to help out as you learn and get acquainted. We try our hardest to keep our code clean and well documented.

You can find the project on `github.com/geoserver <https://www.github.com/geoserver/>`_. Anyone can submit pull requests, following our `contributing policy <https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__, which will be evaluated by the team.

To learn more about contributing to the GeoServer codebase, we recommend reading the `Developers Guide <https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/developer/>`__ and joining GeoServer Developers (see below).

.. note:: 
   
   For `commit access <https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/developer/policies/committing.html>`__ new developers can request to work on a community module immediately, or make contributions over time to earn a nomination for full committ access.
   

Documentation
-------------

Another crucial way to help out is with documentation. Whether it's adding tutorials or just correcting mistakes, every contribution serves to make the project more healthy. And the best part is that you do not need to be a developer in order to contribute.

Our official documentation is contained as part of our `official code repository <https://www.github.com/geoserver/>`_. Anyone can submit pull requests, which will be evaluated by the team.
