Configuring HTTP Header Proxy Authentication
============================================

Introduction
------------

Proxy authentication is used in multi-tier system. The user/principal authenticates
at the proxy and the proxy provides the authentication information to other services.

This tutorial shows how to configure GeoServer to accept authentication information
passed by HTTP header attribute(s). In this scenario GeoServer will do no actual authentication itself.


Prerequisites
-------------

This tutorial uses the `curl <https://curl.haxx.se/>`_ utility to issue HTTP 
request that test authentication. Install curl before proceeding.

.. note::

   Any utility that supports setting HTTP header attributes can be used in
   place of curl. 

Configure the HTTP header filter
--------------------------------

#. Start GeoServer and login to the web admin interface as the ``admin`` user.
#. Click the ``Authentication`` link located under the ``Security`` section of
   the navigation sidebar.

       :align: center

#. Scroll down to the ``Authentication Filters`` panel and click the ``Add new`` link.

    .. figure:: images/digest2.jpg
       :align: center

#. Click the ``HTTP Header`` link.

    .. figure:: images/digest3.jpg
       :align: center

#. Fill in the fields of the settings form as follows:

   * Set ``Name`` to "proxy"
   * Set ``Request header attribute`` to "sdf09rt2s"
   * Set ``Role source`` to "User group service"
   * Set the name of the user group service to "default"

Additional information about role services is here :ref:`security_rolesystem_rolesource`

   .. warning::

      The tutorial uses the obscure "sdf09rt2s" name for the header attribute. 
      Why not use "user" or "username" ?. In a proxy scenario a relationship
      of trust is needed between the proxy and GeoServer. An attacker could easily
      send an HTTP request with an HTTP header attribute "user" and value "admin"
      and operate as an administrator.

      One possibility is to configure the network infrastructure preventing such
      requests from all IP addresses except the IP of the proxy.

      This tutorial uses a obscure header attribute name which should be a shared
      secret between the proxy and GeoServer. Additionally, the use of SSL is recommended,
      otherwise the shared secret is transported in plain text.
      

#. Save.
#. Back on the authentication page scroll down to the ``Filter Chains`` panel. 
#. Select "Default" from the list of filter chains.

   .. figure:: images/digest8.jpg
      :align: center
#. Scroll down to the ``Chain filters`` section and unselect the ``basic`` filter and select the ``proxy`` filter. Position the
   the ``proxy`` filter before the ``anonymous`` filter. 

   .. figure:: images/digest5.jpg
      :align: center
#. Click close at the bottom of the page and then click Save back on the Authentication page to save your filter chain changes.

Secure OGC service requests
---------------------------

In order to test the authentication settings configured in the previous section
a service or resource must be first secured. The ``Default`` filter chain is the
chain applied to all OGC service requests so a service security rule must be 
configured.

#. From the GeoServer home page and click the ``Services`` link located under the 
   ``Security`` section of the navigation sidebar.
   
   .. figure:: images/digest6.jpg
      :align: center
   
#. On the Service security page click the ``Add new rule`` link and add a catch all
   rule that secures all OGC service requests requiring the ``ADMIN``
   role.
   
   .. figure:: images/digest7.jpg
      :align: center
      
#. Save.

Test a proxy login
------------------

#. Execute the following curl command::

      curl -v  -G "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wfs?request=getcapabilities"
   
   The result should be a 403 response signaling that access is denied. The output 
   should look something like the following::

	* About to connect() to localhost port 8080 (#0)
	*   Trying ::1... connected
	> GET /geoserver/wfs?request=getcapabilities HTTP/1.1
	> User-Agent: curl/7.22.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0 OpenSSL/1.0.1 zlib/1.2.3.4 libidn/1.23 librtmp/2.3
	> Host: localhost:8080
	> Accept: */*
	> 
	< HTTP/1.1 403 Access Denied
	< Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
	< Content-Length: 1407
	< Server: Jetty(6.1.8)
	< 
	<html>
	<head>
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"/>
	<title>Error 403 Access Denied</title>
	</head>
        ...

#. Execute the same command but specify the ``--header`` option.::
   
     curl -v --header "sdf09rt2s: admin" -G "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wfs?request=getcapabilities"
    
   The result should be a successful authentication and contain the normal WFS capabilities response.

   .. note::
      When setting the header ``name: value`` pair, the header ``name`` should match the ``Request Header Attribute`` 
      that was set when creating the new Authentication Filter, and the ``value`` must match the username for a user
      who has the correct Role set. The username value is case sensitive. 
      
      In the above example, the ``admin`` user is assigned to the ``ADMIN`` role which is the role that was selected in 
      the service rule we created. If you had a diferent user that was assigned to the ``ADMIN`` role, you could instead
      use the username for that user as the ``value`` in the header and you should get the correct capabilities response.
