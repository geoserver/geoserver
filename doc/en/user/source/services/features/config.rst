Configuration of OGC API - Features module
------------------------------------------

The service operates as an additional protocol for sharing vector data along side Web Feature Service.

Service configuration
''''''''''''''''''''''

The service is configured using:

* The existing :ref:`wfs` settings to define title, abstract, and output formats.
  
  This is why the service page is titled ``GeoServer Web Feature Service`` by default.

* Contact information defined in :ref:`config_contact`.

* Extra links can be added on a per-service or per-collection basis as indicated in :ref:`ogcapi_links`.

Feature Service conformances
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The OGC API Feature Service is modular, allowing you to enable/disable the functionality you wish to include.
  
* By default stable Standards and Community Standards are enabled. If WFS is strict, only official Standards are enabled and community standards are disabled
  
* The OpenAPI service description is mandatory and may not be disabled.
  
* The HTML and GeoJSON output formats are built-in and may not be disabled.

* CQL2 Filter conformances.
  
  Both the Text and JSON formats for CQL2 are available and may be enabled or disabled.
  
  The remaining conformances reflect the built-in CQL2 implementation and may not be edited. The conformances marked enabled have been implemented, and the disabled conformances have not yet been implemented.
