Quickstart
==========

.. note:: If you are using GeoServer locally, the GEOSERVER_URL is usually ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver``

Viewing a layer
---------------

Once GeoServer is installed and running, open up a web browser and go to the web admin console (:ref:`web_admin`).  Navigate to the :ref:`layerpreview` by clicking on the Layer Preview link at the bottom of the left sidebar. You will be presented with a list of the currently configured layers in your GeoServer instance. Find the row that says ``topp:states``. To the right of the layer click on the link that says **KML**.

If Google Earth is correctly installed on your computer, you will see a dialog asking how to open the file. Select **Open with Google Earth**.

      Open with Google Earth

When Google Earth is finished loading the result will be similar to below.

Direct access to KML
--------------------

All of the configured FeatureTypes are available to be output as KML (and thus loaded into Google Earth). The URL structure for KMLs is::

   http://GEOSERVER_URL/wms/kml?layers=<layername>

For example, the topp:states layer URL is::

   http://GEOSERVER_URL/wms/kml?layers=topp:states
   
.. _google_earth_kmz:

Requesting KMZ output
---------------------

GeoServer can also return KMZ, the compressed form of KML, for convenient distribution and offline use. Issue a standard WMS request and set the format to ``application/vnd.google-earth.kmz``::

   http://GEOSERVER_URL/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.1&request=GetMap&layers=topp:states&styles=&srs=EPSG:4326&bbox=-130,24,-66,50&width=512&height=256&format=application/vnd.google-earth.kmz

The downloaded ``.kmz`` file is a zip archive containing the KML document (normally ``wms.kml``) together with any referenced resources. GeoServer automatically copies icon PNG files used in the map into an ``images/`` folder inside the archive so that placemarks render correctly even when the KMZ is opened offline.
  
  
Adding a Network Link
---------------------

An alternative to serving KML directly into Google Earth is to use a Network Link. A Network Link allows for better integration into Google Earth. For example, using a Network Link enables the user to refresh the data within Google Earth, without having to retype a URL, or click on links in the GeoServer Map Preview again. 

To add a Network Link, pull down the **Add** menu, and go to **Network Link**. The **New Network Link** dialog box will appear. 
Name your layer in the **Name** field. (This will show up in **My Places** on the main Google Earth screen.) Set **Link** to::

   http://GEOSERVER_URL/wms/kml?layers=topp:states
   
(Don't forget to replace the GEOSERVER_URL.)  Click **OK**. You can now save this layer in your **My Places**.
