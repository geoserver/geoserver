.. _wms_vendor_parameters:

WMS vendor parameters
=====================

WMS vendor parameters are custom request parameters that are not defined in the WMS specification, but are allowed by it.  GeoServer supports a variety of WMS vendor-specific parameters.

angle
-----

``angle=x`` rotates the output map around its center by `x` degrees clockwise. The rotation is supported in all raster formats, PDF, and SVG based on the Batik producer (which is the default).

buffer
------

The ``buffer`` parameter specifies the number of extra pixels that should be taken into account when rendering a map (using the :ref:`wms_getmap` operation).  This is important for catching features that are outside the current bounding box, but whose styling is thick enough to be visible inside the relevant area.  GeoServer will try to compute this buffer automatically by parsing the SLD, but that may fail if line widths and point sizes are not literal values.  When these size are linked to attributes, this parameter may be necessary.

The syntax for using a buffer is::

   buffer=<bufferwidth>
   
where ``<bufferwidth>`` is the radius of the buffer in pixels.

Buffer also applies to the :ref:`wms_getfeatureinfo` operation.  This creates a "search radius", where feature info will be returned for the area around the location of the request.  This is useful when working with an OpenLayers map (such as those generated by the :ref:`layerpreview` page) as it relaxes the need to click precisely on a point for the appropriate feature info to be returned.

Both in the :ref:`wms_getmap` and in the :ref:`wms_getfeatureinfo` cases the default ``buffer`` value is computed automatically for each layer by inspecting the associated style. This happens by visiting the style, checking all active symbolizers, and returning the size of the biggest one (biggest point symbolizer, thickest line symbolizer). This automatic inspection won't work if:

  * the SLD contains sizes that are specified as feature attribute values
  * the SLD contains external graphics and does not specify their size explicitly

In case the automatic evaluation fails, the following defaults apply:

  * 0 pixels for :ref:`wms_getmap` requests
  * 2 pixels for :ref:`wms_getfeatureinfo` requests

cql_filter
----------

The ``cql_filter`` parameter is similar to the standard ``filter`` parameter, but the filter is expressed using CQL (Common Query Language).  
This makes the filter logic more concise and readable.  
However, CQL isn't as flexible as OGC filters, and can't express certain kinds of queries. 
In particular, filtering by feature ID is not supported.  

If more than one layer is specified in the ``layers`` parameter, then more than one filter can be specified, each corresponding to a layer.

An example of a CQL filter is::

   cql_filter=INTERSECT(the_geom,%20POINT%20(-74.817265%2040.5296504))
   
See also the :ref:`cql_tutorial` tutorial.

env
---

The ``env`` parameter defines the set of substitution values that can be used in SLD variable substitution. The syntax is::

  env=param1:value1;param2:value2;...
  
See :ref:`sld_parameter_substitution` for more information.

featureid
---------

The ``featureid`` parameter filters by feature ID, a unique value given to all features.  Multiple features can be selected by separating the featureids by comma, as in this example::

   featureid=states.1,states.45  

filter
------

The WMS specification allows only limited filtering of data.  
GeoServer expands the WMS filter capability to match those allowed by WFS.

The ``filter`` parameter encodes a list of OGC filters (encoded in in XML).  
The list is enclosed in () parenthesis.  
When used in a GET request, the XML element brackets need to be URL-encoded.  

If more than one layer is specified in the ``layers`` parameter, then more than one filter can be specified, each corresponding to a layer.

An example of an OGC filter encoded in a GET request is::

   filter=%3CFilter%20xmlns:gml=%22http://www.opengis.net/gml%22%3E%3CIntersects%3E%3CPropertyName%3Ethe_geom%3C/PropertyName%3E%3Cgml:Point%20srsName=%224326%22%3E%3Cgml:coordinates%3E-74.817265,40.5296504%3C/gml:coordinates%3E%3C/gml:Point%3E%3C/Intersects%3E%3C/Filter%3E
   
format_options
--------------

The ``format_options`` is a container for parameters that are format-specific. The options in it are expressed as::
  
    param1:value1;param2:value2;...
    
The supported format options are:

* ``antialiasing`` (values = ``on``, ``off``, ``text``): controls the use of antialiased rendering in raster output. 
* ``dpi``: sets the rendering dpi in raster outputs. The OGC standard dpi is 90, but if you need to create high resolution images (e.g for printing) it is advisable to request a larger image and set a higher dpi. For example, to print  a 100x100 image at 300dpi it is advisable to ask for a 333x333 image with the dpi value set to 300. In general the image size should be increased by a factor equal to ``targetDpi/90`` and the target dpi set in the format options.
* ``layout``: chooses a named layout for decorations, a tool for visually annotating GeoServer's WMS output.  Layouts are used to add decorators such as compasses and legends to the maps produced by GeoServer.  :ref:`wms_decorations` are discussed further in the :ref:`advanced_config` section.

kmattr
------

The ``kmattr`` parameter determines whether the KML returned by GeoServer should include clickable attributes or not.  This parameter primarily affects Google Earth rendering.  The syntax is::

   kmattr=[true|false]

kmscore
-------

The ``kmscore`` parameter sets whether GeoServer should render KML data as vector or raster.  This parameter primarily affects Google Earth rendering.  The syntax is::

   kmscore=<value>

The possible values for this parameter are between ``0`` (force raster output) and ``100`` (force vector output).

maxFeatures and startIndex
--------------------------

GeoServer WMS supports the parameters ``maxFeatures`` and ``startIndex``.  Both can be used together to provide "paging" support.  This is helpful in situations such as KML crawling, where it is desirable to be able to retrieve the map in sections when there are a large number of features.

Note that not every layer will support paging.

The ``startindex`` parameter specifies with a positive integer the index in an ordered list of features to start rendering.  For a layer to be queried this way, the underlying feature source shall support paging (such as PostGIS).

The ``maxfeatures`` parameter sets a limit on the amount of features rendered, using a positive integer.  When used with ``startindex``, the features rendered will be the ones starting at the ``startindex`` value.


namespace
---------

WMS :ref:`wms_getcap` requests can be filtered to only return layers corresponding to a particular namespace.  The syntax is::

   namespace=<namespace>

where ``<namespace>`` is the namespace prefix.

Using an invalid namespace prefix will not cause any errors, but the document returned will not contain information on any layers, only layer groups.

.. note::  This only affects the capabilities document, and not any other requests. WMS requests given to other layers, even when a different namespace is specified, will still be processed.


palette
------- 

It is sometimes advisable (for speed and bandwidth reasons) to downsample the bit depth of returned maps.  The way to do this is to create an image with a limited color palette, and save it in the ``palettes`` directory inside your GeoServer Data Directory.  It is then possible to specify the ``palette`` parameter of the form::

   palette=<image>

where ``<image>`` is the filename of the palette image (without the extension).  To force a web-safe palette, you can use the syntax ``palette=safe``.  For more information see the tutorial on :ref:`tutorials_palettedimages`
  
propertyName
------------

Valid only for the ``GetFeatureInfo`` request, it allows to select which properties are going to be included in the output.
Ror vector layers it works in the obvious way, for rasters it selects the bands, for cascaded WMS the GML properties returned
by the remote server.
The syntax is the same as ``WFS GetFeature``, in particular if you have a single layer in the request the syntax will be::

   &propertyName=name1,...,nameN
   
whilst if you are requesting multiple layers in output the syntax will become::

   &propertyName=(nameLayer11,...,nameLayer1N)...(name1LayerN,...,nameNLayerN)
  

tiled
-----

When using a tiled client such as OpenLayers, there can be issues with duplicated labels. To deal with this, GeoServer can create metatiles, that is, images are rendered and then split into smaller tiles (by default in a 3x3 pattern) before being served.
In order for meta-tiling to work properly, the tile size must be set to 256x256 pixels, and two extra parameters must be set.

The ``tiled`` parameter is of the form::

   tiled=[yes|no]

For metatiling to function, this must be set to ``yes``.

tilesorigin
-----------

The ``tilesorigin`` parameter, also necessary for metatiling, is of the form::

   tilesorigin=x,y
   
where ``x`` and ``y`` are the coordinates of the lower left corner (the "origin") of the tile grid system in OpenLayers. A good way to setup the tilesorigin in OpenLayers is referencing the map  extents directly (if the max extents are modified dynamically, also remember to update the ``tilesorigin`` of each meta-tiled layer accordingly):

.. code-block:: javascript 
   :linenos: 

    var options = {
        ...
        maxExtent: new OpenLayers.Bounds(-180, -90, 180, 90),
        ...
    };
    map = new OpenLayers.Map('map', options);

    tiled = new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS(
        "Layer name", "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wms",
        {
            srs: 'EPSG:4326',
            width: 391,
            styles: '',
            height: 550,
            layers: 'layerName',
            format: 'image/png',
            tiled: true,
            tilesorigin: [map.maxExtent.left, map.maxExtent.bottom]  
        },
        {buffer: 0} 
    );
