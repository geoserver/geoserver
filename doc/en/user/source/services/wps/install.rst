Installing the WPS extension
============================

The WPS module is not a part of GeoServer core, but instead must be installed as an extension.  To install WPS:

#. Navigate to the :website:`GeoServer download page <download>`.

#. Find the page that matches the exact version of GeoServer you are running.

   .. warning::  Be sure to match the version of the extension with that of GeoServer, otherwise errors will occur.

#. Download the WPS extension:

   * |release| :download_extension:`wps`
   * |version| :nightly_extension:`wps`
   
   The download link for :guilabel:`WPS` will be in the :guilabel:`Extensions` section under :guilabel:`Other`.

#. Extract the files in this archive to the :file:`WEB-INF/lib` directory of your GeoServer installation.

#. Restart GeoServer.

After restarting, load the :ref:`web_admin`.  If the extension loaded properly, you should see an extra entry for WPS in the :guilabel:`Service Capabilities` column.  If you don't see this entry, check the logs for errors.

Configuring WPS
---------------

WPS processes are subject to the same feature limit as the WFS service.
The limit applies to process **input**, so even processes which summarize data
and return few results will be affected if applied to very large datasets.
The limit is set on the :ref:`services_webadmin_wfs` Admin page.

.. warning::  If the limit is encountered during process execution, no error is given. Any results computed by the process may be incomplete
