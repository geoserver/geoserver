Extension Install
=================

This workshop course requires GeoServer with a few additional extensions.

* CSS Styling: Quickly and easily generate SLD files
* YSLD Styling: An alternative styling language to SLD
* Importer: Wizard for bulk import of data

On Windows the following is recommended:
          
* `FireFox <http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>`_
* `Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org>`_

The **CSS extension** is distributed as a supported GeoServer extension. Extensions are unpacked into the ``libs`` folder of the GeoServer application. The **YSLD extension** is a new addition to geoserver and is distributed as an unsupported GeoServer extension.

.. note:: In a classroom setting these extensions have already been installed.
