Web administration interface
============================

The Web administration interface is a web-based tool for configuring all aspects of GeoServer, from adding data to changing service settings. In a default GeoServer installation, this interface is accessed via a web browser at ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver/web``. However, this URL may vary depending on your local installation.

Welcome
-------

* The :ref:`welcome` page lists the web services published by GeoServer.
  
  When logged in with administrative credentials a configuration overview is provided, along with any information or warning notifications.

About & Status
--------------

The :guilabel:`About & Status` section provides access to GeoServer diagnostic and configuration tools, and can be particularly useful for debugging.  

* The :ref:`config_serverstatus` page shows a summary of server configuration parameters and run-time status. 

* The :ref:`GeoServer Logs <logging>` page shows the GeoServer log output. This is useful for determining errors without having to leave the browser.

* The :ref:`config_contact` page sets the public contact information available in the Capabilities document of the WMS server.

* The :ref:`about` section provides links to the GeoServer documentation, homepage and bug tracker.
  
  **You do not need to be logged into GeoServer to access this page.**
  
Data
----

The :ref:`Data` section contains configuration options for all the different data-related settings. 

* The :ref:`Layer Preview <layerpreview>` page provides links to layer previews in different output formats, including the frequently used OpenLayers and KML formats. This page helps to visually verify and explore the configuration of a particular layer.

  **You do not need to be logged into GeoServer to access the Layer Preview.**

* The :ref:`Workspaces <data_webadmin_workspaces>` page displays a list of workspaces, with the ability to add, edit, and delete. Also shows which workspace is the default for the server. 

* The :ref:`Stores <data_webadmin_stores>` page displays a list of stores, with the ability to add, edit, and delete. Details include the workspace associated with the store, the type of store (data format), and whether the store is enabled.

* The :ref:`Layers <data_webadmin_layers>` page displays a list of layers, with the ability to add, edit, and delete. Details include the workspace and store associated with the layer, whether the layer is enabled, and the spatial reference system (SRS) of the layer.

* The :ref:`Layer Groups <data_webadmin_layergroups>` page displays a list of layer groups, with the ability to add, edit, and delete. Details include the associated workspace (if any).

* The :ref:`Styles <styling_webadmin>` page displays a list of styles, with the ability to add, edit, and delete. Details include the associated workspace (if any).

In each of these pages that contain a table, there are three different ways to locate an object: sorting, searching, and paging. To alphabetically sort a data type, click on the column header. For simple searching, enter the search criteria in the search box and hit Enter. And to page through the entries (25 at a time), use the arrow buttons located on the bottom and top of the table.

**These pages are shown to administrators, and users that have workspace or layer admin permissions.**
