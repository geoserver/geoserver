## Development Environment

GeoServer Development requires Java 17, Maven, and git.

### SDKMan

[SDKMan](https://sdkman.io) helps manage and change between different development environments (available on Linux, macOS, and Windows WSL):

```bash
# list to determine latest Temurin JDK 17
sdk list java | grep "17.*-tem"

# Installing latest Temurin JDK 17 shown above
sdk install java 17.0.16-tem
sdk install maven
```

### Linux

Obtain OpenJDK 17, Maven and git from your Linux distribution:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk 
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install maven
```

### macOS

1. Install Java Runtime Environment

   Download and install Java 17 runtime environment, as provided by adoptium macOS installers:
   https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases?version=17

   Update your shell environment with:
   
  ```bash
  export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptiumjdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
  ```
  
  The system ``/usr/bin/java`` makes use of JAVA_HOME setting above.

2. Git is incuded with  XCode Command Line Tools.
   
   ```bash
   xcode-select â€“-install
   ```

   You may also download and install git:

   https://git-scm.com/download/mac

3. Download and install Maven:

   https://maven.apache.org/download.html

### Windows

1. Install Java Runtime Environment

   Download and install Java 17 runtime environment, as provided by Adoptium windows installers:
   https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases?version=17

   Update Windows *Environment Variables*:

   * Create an environment variable JAVA_HOME and point it to your Java JDK directory.
   * Modify the PATH variable and add: ;%JAVA_HOME%/bin

2. Download and install git:

   https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

3. Download and install Maven:

   https://maven.apache.org/download.html

## Building Locally

1. Get the source code

   Go to the command line and run:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver.git
   ```

2. Build the source code
   
   Go to the command line and navigate to the folder you just checked out. Now run:
   
   ```bash
   cd geoserver
   cd src
   mvn clean install
   ```
   
3. Running locally:
   
   ```bash
   cd web/app
   mvn jetty:run
   ```

Troubleshooting
---------------

The build process may fail because of several reasons:

### Unavailable dependencies

Maven tries to download dependencies which might not be available on the server side yet.

* Try again in a few minutes.

  GeoServer primarily uses repo.osgeo.org to cache dependencies in one location to avoid this previously common problem.
  
  
  * https://repo.osgeo.org/#browse/browse:release
  * https://repo.osgeo.org/#browse/browse:snapshot
  
* If maven has cached that the dependency is not available, you can use `-U` to force it to update dependencies
  
  ```bash
  mvn clean install -U
  ```

### Failing tests


Maven runs existing tests automatically. If some of them fail, the build fails.

* Try again: Some tests, like app-schema are not stable, you can try to ``-rf <module>` to resume the build from the point of failure:
  
  ```bash
  mvn clean install -rf :gs-app-schema
  ```
  
* Look at while the test is failing, and send a pull-request, thanks!
  
  Running test in a wide range of environments helps make GeoServer better. Please look at while
  the test is failing for you. 

* Discouraged: You can tell Maven not to run the tests.
  
  ```
  mvn -DskipTests=true install
  ```
