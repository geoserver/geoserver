# PMTiles DataStore Extension

This module adds support for Protomaps PMTiles as a DataStore in GeoServer.

PMTiles is a cloud-optimized single-file archive format for tiled data, enabling efficient access to vector tiles from local storage, HTTP servers, and cloud object storage (S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) without requiring a tile server.
