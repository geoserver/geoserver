  STATUS as of July 2008: CLEAN

    * All classes created for the geotools project by the module maintainer 
      have been updated to assign (c) to OSGEO in the header.
      
    * Much of the binding classes (marked with a @generated tag and then modified by hand)
      lack the @author attribution tag.
