A coverage incorporates a mapping from a spatiotemporal domain to a range set, the latter providing the set in which the attribute values live.  The range set may be an arbitrary set including discrete lists, integer or floating point ranges, and multi-dimensional vector spaces.
A coverage can be viewed as the graph of the coverage function f:A à B, that is as the set of ordered pairs {(x, f(x)) | where x is in A}. This view is especially applicable to the GML encoding of a coverage.  In the case of a discrete coverage, the domain set A is partitioned into a collection of subsets (typically a disjoint collection) A = UAi and the function f is constant on each Ai. For a spatial domain, the Ai are geometry elements, hence the coverage can be viewed as a collection of (geometry,value) pairs, where the value is an element of the range set.  If the spatial domain A is a topological space then the coverage can be viewed as a collection of (topology,value) pairs, where the topology element in the pair is a topological n-chain (in GML terms this is a gml:TopoPoint, gml:TopoCurve, gml:TopoSurface or gml:TopoSolid). 
A coverage is implemented as a GML feature. We can thus speak of a "temperature distribution feature", or a "remotely sensed image feature", or a "soil distribution feature".
As is the case for any GML object, a coverage object may also be the value of a property of a feature.

GML is an OGC Standard.

			<documentation>A discrete coverage consists of a domain set, range set and optionally a coverage function. The domain set consists of either spatial or temporal geometry objects, finite in number. The range set is comprised of a finite number of attribute values each of which is associated to every direct position within any single spatiotemporal object in the domain. In other words, the range values are constant on each spatiotemporal object in the domain. This coverage function maps each element from the coverage domain to an element in its range. The coverageFunction element describes the mapping function.

			<documentation>for efficiency reasons, GML also provides a means of encoding the range set in an arbitrary external encoding, such as a binary file.  This encoding may be "well-known" but this is not required. This mode uses the gml:File element.
The values of the coverage (attribute values in the range set) are transmitted in a external file that is referenced from the XML structure described by gml:FileType.  The external file is referenced by the gml:fileReference property that is an anyURI (the gml:fileName property has been deprecated).  This means that the external file may be located remotely from the referencing GML instance. 
The gml:compression property points to a definition of a compression algorithm through an anyURI.  This may be a retrievable, computable definition or simply a reference to an unambiguous name for the compression method.
The gml:mimeType property points to a definition of the file mime type.
The gml:fileStructure property is defined by a codelist. Note further that all values shall be enclosed in a single file. Multi-file structures for values are not supported in GML.
The semantics of the range set is described as above using the gml:rangeParameters property.
Note that if any compression algorithm is applied, the structure above applies only to the pre-compression or post-decompression structure of the file.
Note that the fields within a record match the gml:valueComponents of the gml:CompositeValue in document order.</documentation>
