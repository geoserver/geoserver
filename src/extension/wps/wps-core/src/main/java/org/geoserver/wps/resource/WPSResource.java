/**
 * A resource managed during a WPS process execution. It can be anything, from a feature type, a file, a directory, an
 * embedded database table. The interface makes sure the resource can be cleaned up when the request execution is
 * terminated, or, if the process is asynchronous, when the results availability expires.
 *
 * <p>Normally all resources linked to a process have to be kept around as long as one of the resulting feature
 * collections or coverages is eligible to be collected: there is no way to know if the processes are computing the
 * result once, or if they are generating streaming outputs that will recompute the results every time they are queried
 * (the ImageN efficient case for coverages would be the latter)
