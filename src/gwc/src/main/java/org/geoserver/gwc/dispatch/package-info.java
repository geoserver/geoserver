/**
 * Classes to integrate GWC service requests with the GeoServer {@link org.geoserver.ows.Dispatcher} framework.
 *
 * <p>How the GWC service request processing is modified to engage into the {@link org.geoserver.ows.Dispatcher} life
 * cycle:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The mapping of incoming requests to {@code /gwc/service/*} to the GWC dispatcher is commented out in
 *       {@code geowebcache-servlet.xml}.
 *   <li>An instance of {@link org.geoserver.ows.OWSHandlerMapping} in {@code geowebcache-geoserver-context.xml}
 *       redirects all requests to {@code /gwc/service/*} to the GeoSever {@link org.geoserver.ows.Dispatcher} instead
 *       of the regular GWC dispatcher.
 *   <li>A GeoServer OWS Service descriptor is configured in {@code geowebcache-geoserver-context.xml} as a
 *       {@link org.geoserver.platform.Service} called {@code "gwc"}, that defines a {@code "dispatch"} operation and
 *       that references the {@link org.geoserver.gwc.dispatch.GwcServiceProxy} as the actual service bean that perfors
 *       that operation.
 *   <li>A {@link org.geoserver.ows.DispatcherCallback} of type
 *       {@link org.geoserver.gwc.dispatch.GwcServiceDispatcherCallback} intercepts OWS service requests and if they're
 *       directed to one of the GWC provided services, initializes the {@link org.geoserver.ows.Request} object with
 *       "gwc" as the request service and "dispatch" as the request operation; with this information, the
 *       {@link org.geoserver.ows.Dispatcher} will find out the "mediator"
 *       {@link org.geoserver.gwc.dispatch.GwcServiceProxy} and call it's {@code dispatch} method.
 *   <li>The {@link org.geoserver.gwc.dispatch.GwcServiceProxy#dispatch dispatch} method in turn redirects the request
 *       to the {@link org.geowebcache.GeoWebCacheDispatcher} and returns a payload
 *       {@link org.geoserver.gwc.dispatch.GwcOperationProxy} object; the {@code Dispatcher} finds out it's to be
 *       handled by the configured {@link org.geoserver.ows.Response} object of type
 *       {@link org.geoserver.gwc.dispatch.GwcResponseProxy}.
 * </ul>
