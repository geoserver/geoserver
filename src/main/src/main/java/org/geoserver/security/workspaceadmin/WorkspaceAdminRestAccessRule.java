/**
 * Represents a REST API access rule for workspace administrators.
 *
 * <p>This class defines URL patterns and HTTP methods that workspace administrators are allowed to access. Each rule
 * consists of:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An Ant-style URL pattern (e.g., "/rest/workspaces/{workspace}/**")
 *   <li>A set of permitted HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
 *   <li>A priority value used for rule ordering
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Rules are defined in the security/rest.workspaceadmin.properties file and loaded by the
 * {@link WorkspaceAdminRESTAccessRuleDAO}. The file is initially populated from a template with default rules that
 * allow workspace administrators to manage resources within their assigned workspaces.
 *
 * <p>Rules have the format:
 *
 * <pre>
 * /url/pattern=METHOD1,METHOD2,...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Where methods can use shorthand values:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>r = Read operations (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE)
 *   <li>w = Write operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
 *   <li>rw = All operations (read + write)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When evaluating access, rules with lower priority values (higher priority) are evaluated before rules with higher
 * values.
 *
 * <p>The class implements {@link ConfigAttribute} to integrate with Spring Security's authorization framework and
 * {@link Comparable} to allow sorting rules by priority.
 *
 * <p>Examples of rule patterns:
 *
 * <pre>
 * /rest/workspaces/{workspace}/**   - All URLs under a specific workspace
 * /rest/namespaces/{workspace}/**    - All namespace URLs for a specific workspace
 * /rest/layers/{workspace}:*         - Layer resources for a specific workspace
 * /rest/resource/workspaces          - The workspaces resource collection
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see WorkspaceAdminRESTAccessRuleDAO
 * @see WorkspaceAdminAuthorizationManager
 * @see WorkspaceAdminRestfulDefinitionSource
