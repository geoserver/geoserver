# Default Workspace Admin REST security configuration
# ---------------------------------------------------
# This file defines the default security rules for workspace administrators 
# accessing the REST API. It is copied to security/rest.workspaceadmin.properties
# in the GeoServer data directory when that file does not exist.
#
# IMPORTANT: REST endpoints that don't match any pattern in this file fall back to the 
# global REST security configuration (rest.properties), which typically restricts access
# to administrators only. Only add patterns for endpoints that workspace administrators
# should be allowed to access.
#
# Format:
#   /url/pattern=METHOD1,METHOD2,...
#
# Shorthand method values:
#   r = Read operations (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE)
#   w = Write operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
#   rw = All operations (read + write)
#

# Workspace and catalog endpoints
# -------------------------------
# Contents filtered out by SecureCatalog based on AdminRequest

# A workspace admin access to the workspaces collections is read-only
/rest/workspaces.{ext}=r
/rest/workspaces=r

# And can only read or update a workspace
/rest/workspaces/{workspace}.{ext}=r,PUT
/rest/workspaces/{workspace}=r,PUT

# But can modify anything else within it
/rest/workspaces/{workspace}/**=rw


# Same for namespaces
/rest/namespaces.{ext}=r
/rest/namespaces=r

/rest/namespaces/{namespace}.{ext}=r,PUT
/rest/namespaces/{namespace}=r,PUT

/rest/namespaces/{namespace}/**=rw

# A workspace admin has rw access to /rest/layers/**.
# The secured catalog will only allow access to layers in its adminable workspaces 
/rest/layers/**=rw

# A workspace admin needs read-only access to global styles
/rest/styles.{ext}=r
/rest/styles/**=r

# Resource access
# ---------------
# Access to resources, contents filtered out by SecureResourceStore
/rest/resource/workspaces=r
/rest/resource/workspaces/{workspace}/**=rw
/rest/resource/**=r

# User account management
# -----------------------
# Leaving /rest/security/self/** open for GET requests to return the 405 error code from UserPasswordController
/rest/security/self/**=rw

# General service endpoints
# -------------------------
# Basic API navigation and discoverability
/rest/fonts.{ext}=r
/rest/fonts/**=r

/rest=r
/rest/=r
/rest.{ext}=r
/rest/index=r
/rest/index.{ext}=r
