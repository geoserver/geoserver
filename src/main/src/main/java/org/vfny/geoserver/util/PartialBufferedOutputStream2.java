/**
 * <b>PartialBufferedOutputStream</b><br>
 * Oct 19, 2005<br>
 * <b>Purpose:</b><br>
 * I have modelled this class after the BufferedOutputStream. Several methods are synchronized as a result. The interior
 * of this class uses a ByteArrayOutputStream when it starts and then a BufferedOutputStream. This is essentially a
 * decorator. This class uses a temporary to-memory OutputStream for initial bufferring. This OutputStream is a
 * ByteArrayOutputStream. Once a pre-defined BUFFER_SIZE has been reached, the output that is stored in the
 * ByteArrayOutputStream is output to the real OutputStream to the response. Further data is then written to that
 * response OutputStream. For the first run of this, we will write to memory for the buffered part. Writing to disk is
 * another option. NOTE: If we switch to writing out to disk, we will have to clean up our temporary files with abort().
 * WARNING: IF you abuse the size of the buffer, you may leak memory if this OutputStream is not terminated. The
 * ByteArrayOutputStream will hold onto its allocated memory even after you call reset() on it. So if you put in 60MB of
 * buffer space, it will stay there until the object is no longer referenced and the garbage collector decides to pick
 * it up. A solution to this would be to use a FileOutputStream instead of the ByteArrayOutputStream. CONTRACT: -close()
 * will NOT flush remaining bytes to the output stream, as per the contract with OutputStream. Close will remove any
 * references to OutputStreams and its HttpServletResponse. -fush() will NOT flush if the buffer is not full. -abort()
 * will succeed if the buffer is not full yet. If the buffer has been filled and the information has been written out to
 * response's OutputStream, the abort reports as having failed. The point of this PartialBufferedOutputStream is to
 * allow an abort before the information has been written out to the real OutputStream. When abort is called the
 * references to any OutputStreams and the HttpServletResponse are removed.
