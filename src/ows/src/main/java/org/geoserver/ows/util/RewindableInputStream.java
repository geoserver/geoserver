// This class wraps the byte inputstreams we're presented with.
// We need it because java.io.InputStreams don't provide
// functionality to reread processed bytes, and they have a habit
// of reading more than one character when you call their read()
// methods.  This means that, once we discover the true (declared)
// encoding of a document, we can neither backtrack to read the
// whole doc again nor start reading where we are with a new
// reader.
//
// This class allows rewinding an inputStream by allowing a mark
// to be set, and the stream reset to that position.  <strong>The
// class assumes that it needs to read one character per
// invocation when it's read() method is inovked, but uses the
// underlying InputStream's read(char[], offset length) method--it
// won't buffer data read this way!</strong>
//
// @task TODO: How about implementing an ability to completely
//             disable buffering performed by this stream?
//             It is very unlikely that someone will read data from
//             the stream byte by byte with <code>read()</code>
//             method, but if they do, the whole content will
//             be unconditionally stored in internal buffer, resulting
//             in additional (and most probably vain) memory impact.
