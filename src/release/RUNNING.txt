               Running The GeoServer Binary Distribution
               =========================================

The binary distribution of GeoServer comes with a built-in Jetty servlet
container so that it can be run directly without the need for additional
software.  For information on other distributions on GeoServer, please
see the website:

    http://geoserver.org


In order to install and run this application, follow these steps:

(0) Download and install a Java Development Kit

* Download a Java Runtime Environment (Java 8 or later) from:

    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/
     or 
    http://openjdk.java.net/

* Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the release.

* Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory
  into which you installed the JDK.

(1) Download and install the GeoServer binary

There is more help available at the GeoServer home page (http://geoserver.org) 

* Download a binary distribution of GeoServer from:

    http://geoserver.org/download/
     or
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver

  The file should be of the form:

    geoserver-a.b.c-bin.zip

  where a.b.c is the version number you are downloading

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "geoserver").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name GEOSERVER_HOME is used to refer to the directory
  where GeoServer resides.


(2) Start Up GeoServer

There are two techniques by which GeoServer can be started:

* Use an environment variable:
  - Set an environment variable GEOSERVER_HOME to the path of the directory
    into which you have installed GeoServer.
  - Execute the shell command:

      Windows:
      %GEOSERVER_HOME%\bin\startup

      UNIX:
      $GEOSERVER_HOME/bin/startup.sh

* Modify your current working directory:
  - Execute the following shell commands:

      Windows:
      cd %GEOSERVER_HOME%\bin
      startup

      UNIX:
      cd $GEOSERVER_HOME/bin
      ./startup.sh

After startup, the default web administration tool included with GeoServer 
will be available by browsing:

    http://localhost:8080/


(3) Shut Down GeoServer

There are two techniques by which GeoServer can be stopped:

* Use an environment variable:
  - Set an environment variable GEOSERVER_HOME to the path of the directory
    into which you have installed GeoServer.
  - Execute the shell command:

      Windows:
      %GEOSERVER_HOME%\bin\shutdown

      UNIX:
      $GEOSERVER_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh

* Modify your current working directory:
  - Execute the following shell commands:

      Windows:
      cd %GEOSERVER_HOME%\bin
      shutdown

      UNIX:
      cd $GEOSERVER_HOME/bin
      ./shutdown.sh


(4) Troubleshooting

There are two common problems encountered when attempting to use the binary
distribution of GeoServer:

 1) Another web server (or other process) is already using port 8080.  This
    is the default HTTP port that GeoServer attempts to bind to at startup.
    To change this port, open the file:

       $GEOSERVER_HOME/start.ini

    and search for 'jetty.port' or '8080'.  Change it to a port that isn't
    in use, but is greater than 1024 (such as 8090).  Save this file and
    restart GeoServer.
    Make sure, of course, that you try to access GeoServer on the new port:

       http://localhost:####

    where #### is the new port.

 2) The "localhost" address can't be found.  This could happen if you're
    behind a proxy.  If so, make sure the proxy configuration for your
    browser knows to not travel through the proxy to access the "localhost"
    address.  Please see your browser's documentation for how to check this.
